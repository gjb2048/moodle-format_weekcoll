/**
 * Collapsed Weeks Information
 *
 * A week based format that solves the issue of the 'Scroll of Death' when a course has many weeks. All
 * weeks have a toggle that displays that week. The current week is displayed by default. One or more
 * weeks can be displayed at any given time. Toggles are persistent on a per browser session per course
 * basis but can be made to perist longer by a small code change. Full installation instructions, code
 * adaptions and credits are included in the 'Readme.txt' file.
 *
 * @package    course/format
 * @subpackage weekcoll
 * @version    See the value of '$plugin->version' in version.php.
 * @copyright  &copy; 2009-onwards G J Barnard in respect to modifications of standard weeks format.
